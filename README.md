Whenever your players catch you off guard and you need a quick random dungeon, it's here with a simple click! :D

That's the sales pitch.

Here are the technical tidbits.

# installation

download this repository, go to src/client and open index.html.
You will be presented with a complex UI of width and height and generate button.
Set the widht and height (represents number of 5 feet squares) and press generate.
and you got yourself a dungeon. 

it works completly offline.
